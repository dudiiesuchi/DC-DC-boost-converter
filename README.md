# DC-DC-boost-converter
Here is a **README** file for your **DC-DC Boost Converter** simulation created in MATLAB/Simulink.

---

## **Overview**
This MATLAB/Simulink model represents a **DC-DC Boost Converter**, which steps up a lower DC input voltage to a higher DC output voltage. The model is built using Simulink blocks, including power electronics components such as MOSFETs, diodes, inductors, capacitors, and control circuits. 

## **Working Principle**
A **Boost Converter** operates by storing energy in an inductor during the ON period of a switching device (MOSFET) and releasing it through a diode to the output capacitor and load during the OFF period. The step-up voltage gain is determined by the **duty cycle** of the pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal controlling the MOSFET.

The relationship between input voltage \( V_{in} \) and output voltage \( V_{out} \) is given by:

\[
V_{out} = \frac{V_{in}}{1 - D}
\]

where **D** is the duty cycle.

## **Components in the Simulink Model**
1. **DC Voltage Source**:
   - Provides the input voltage.
   - Typically, a low-voltage DC source (e.g., 12V).

2. **Inductor**:
   - Stores energy when the switch is ON.
   - Releases energy when the switch is OFF.

3. **MOSFET (Switching Device)**:
   - Controlled by a PWM signal to regulate the energy transfer.

4. **Diode**:
   - Ensures unidirectional current flow to the output.

5. **Capacitor**:
   - Smoothens the output voltage and reduces ripples.

6. **Resistive Load**:
   - Represents the output load where the boosted voltage is applied.

7. **PWM Generator**:
   - Generates a switching signal for the MOSFET.
   - Determines the boost converter's output voltage.

8. **Measurement Blocks**:
   - Voltage and current sensors to analyze system performance.
   - Display and Scope blocks for real-time visualization.
